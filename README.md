# flag-memory

TL;DR  
My boyfriend and I are huge geography nerds, and I wanted to learn Javascript & React.

## The game
It's a basic memory cards game.  
You need to match a flag and its capital city.


## How to play
You need to have [npm and NodeJS installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).  
Then, just run  
```
git clone https://github.com/anacltd/flag-memory.git
cd flag-memory
npm start
```
